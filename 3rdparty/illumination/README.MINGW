Introduction
============

* This documentation assumes that you install MinGW to c:\mingw and
  MSys to c:\msys\1.0. You can however install theem anywhere
  else (while MinGW and MSys might have some installation
  recommendations, too). Just exchange the path with your chosen paths.

Install MinGW
=============

* Entpack binutils-2.17.50-20070129-1.tar.gz to c:\mingw
* Entpack gcc-core-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz to c:\mingw
* Entpack gcc-g++-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz to c:\mingw
* If you are using Windows Vista:
  Entpack gcc-vista-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz to c:\mingw
* Entpack mingw-runtime-3.12.tar.gz to c:\mingw
* Entapck w32api-3.9.tar.gz to c:\mingw

Install MSys
============

* Install MSYS-1.0.10.exe (and point post installation script to your
  MinGW installation)
* Install msysDTK-1.0.1.exe
* Update the msys installation by entpacking
   msysCORE-1.0.11-2007.01.19-1.tar.bz2 to the msys/1.0 directory.
* For Windows Vista you currently need to install an manifest files for
  the msys command "install", "install-info" and "patch"! See cygwin
  mailing list for details...

Prepare mingPORT installation...
================================

* Download wget-1.9.1-mingwPORT.tar.bz2 and wget-1.9.1.tar.gz
* Goto msys-shell
* Entpack wget-1.9.1-mingwPORT.tar.bz2 to /tmp
* Copy wget-1.9.1.tar.gz to /tmp
* Goto subdirectory /tmp/wget-1.9.1/mingwPORT and execute mingwPORT.sh
* Answer all question with default value but the first regarding
  download.
  This will build and install wget (which is needed for installation
  of the next additional packages).
* After successfull execution you should have a working wget

Install additional mingPORTs
============================

* Go online (the mingwPORT.sh scripts you will call now, will fetch
  application sources from the internet).

* For packages below: Enpack package (skipping the package-named
  directory in the archive of course), enter the mingwPORT directory and
  call mingwPORT.sh to download, compile and install it.
- autoconf-2.61-mingwPORT.tar.bz2 (you can find this package currently
  only in the patch tracker on the Sourceforge page for MinGW)
- automake-1.10-mingwPORT.tar.bz2 (you can find this package currently
  only in the patch tracker on the Sourceforge page for MinGW)
- zlib-1.2.3-mingwPORT.tar.bz2
- libpng-1.2.8-mingwPORT.tar.bz2
- libiconv-1.10-mingwPORT.tar.bz2 (you need to do a
  "touch c:/ming/bin/iconv" before)
- Copy <MinGW>/bin/libiconv2.dll to iconv.dll to get pkg-config working
- libtool-1.5.22-mingwPORT.tar.bz

Get pkg-config to work
======================

* To get pkgconfig working, go to
  "http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html", download the
  following packages and enpack them to your mingw directory
  (skipping the package-named directory in the archive of course).
- glib-2.6.5.zip
- gettext-runtime-0.13.1.zip
- pkgconfig-0.15.zip

Compile and install libxml2
===========================

* Add XML support using libxml2:
- download the source archive (currently libxml2-2.6.28.tar.gz) for
  libxml2 (www.libxml.org)
- Enpack it, call "configure", "make" and "make install". This will
  install libxml2 to /usr/local/

Fix installation
================

* Copy the contents of "c:\mingw\share\aclocal to"
  "c:\msys\1.0\share\aclocal"(that seems to be the searchpath for
  autoconf) Otherwise the PKG_CONFIG macro will not be found
  by autoconf (it will not appear in "aclocal.m4").

Set shell environment
=====================

* set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the following dirctories:
- Your Illumination top level directory, to allow building of other
  Illumination programs using configure and make.
- Add /c/mingw/lib/pkgconfig to make pkg-config find the libpng package.
- Add /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig to make pkg-config find the
  libxml2 package.

Build Illumination, demos and applications
==========================================

* Build Illumination
- Checkout the Illumination sources as described on the sourceforge page
- Call the reconf script (this should not show any errors)
- Call configure (might show missing packages and functions but should
  not stop with error)
- Call make

* Build the various examples and applications in the Illumination
  subversion repository
- Call reconf, configure, make
- Execute src/.libs/<Application>.exe
