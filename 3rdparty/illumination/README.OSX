Introduction
============

To compile Illumination under Mac OS X you need the Apple development
package.

We further suggest to use Fink to install the necessary third party
libraries, while in principle any way resulting in the necessray
third party libraries installed should work.

You need subversion client to check out the current development
version.

Currently Illumination can be compiled and run under Mac OS X
using the X11 library and server as part of the Mac OS X distribution.

The Curses backend will work, too.

Fink
====

Following packages should be installed (other packages may necessary or
dependent packages may installed automatically):

autoconf 2.5
automake 1.9
libiconv
libjpeg
libpng
libtiff
libtool14
libungif
libxml2
ncurses-dev
pkgconfig

Make sure that the binaries of the Fink installation (normally "/sw/bin")
are before the corresponding Apple tools in the search path.


X11
===

You can call the configure script without any parameters. The X11 libraries
will be autodetected.

Since there seems to be issues with correctly handling the alt key as
alt I just added a hack that interprets the Apple key als X11 alt key,
too.
