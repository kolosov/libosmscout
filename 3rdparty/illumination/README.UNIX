Introduction
============

This document describes some necessarry environment settings
for getting Illumination to run under Linux.

Required Packages
=================

Under Unix Illumination will use autoconf, automake and pkg-config
for detecting and adapting to the environment.

For Unix Illumination currently offers X11 or Curses backends. You need
the necessary development stuff for this packackes to get some visual
output.

If you add Gtk (Gtk base libraries like Gdk and Gconf) development
packages, Illumination will be able to use Gtk theming code.

If you add gstreamer development headers Illumination will be able to
output sound using gstreamer.

Adding hildon (maemo) devlopment headers, Illumination will embed itself into
the hildon environment (on screen keyboard, theming etc...).

Debian/Ubuntu
=============

Packages
--------

At the time of writing building Illumination required the following
packages (together with their dependencies and recommendations):

* autoconf (recommends automake)
* pkg-config (for detetcting available packages during configure)
* libtool (for easy building of static and shared libraries)
* libstdc++6-4.3-dev (depnending of te excact g++ version used)
* libxml2-dev (for loading and storing XMl files)
* subversion (for downloading the sources)

For X11 support:
* libx11-dev (for using the X11 backend)
* libxft-dev
* libxext-dev

For GTK support:
* libgtk2.0-dev
* libdbus-glib-1-dev
* libgstreamer0.10-dev (for sound and video support)
* libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev (for sound and video support)

For Curses/terminal support:
* libncurses5-dev

Other, optional packages:
* libcairo2-dev (insteadof using X11 drawing primitives)
* libgif-dev  (for loading and storing of gif images)
* libjpeg62-dev (for loading and storing of jpg images)
* libpng12-dev (for loading and storing of png images)
* libtiff4-dev (for loading and storing of tiff images)

Downloading source
------------------

Sources can be downloaded by using the following svn command:

svn checkout http://illumination.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/illumination/trunk/Illumination <target directory>

<target directory> should be a new, empty directory named "Illumination"
(you can of course choose another name if you like).

Initial setup
-------------

Enter the Illumination directory and call:

./autogen.sh

This should generate a up to date configure script (together with helper scripts).

After that call the generated configure script:

./configure

You can parse various options to the configure script to enable/disable
various features but normally the script should autodetect everything on
its own.

Please check the result for the following (similiar spelled) lines:

checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes

=> pkg-config found

checking for XML2... yes

=> XML parser found

checking for X... libraries , headers

=> X11 found

checking for XFT... yes

=> Xft found

checking for CAIRO... yes

=> Cairo backend enabled (optional)

checking for curses and panel library... yes

=> Curses enabled (optional)

checking for PNG... yes

=> PNG support enabled (optional)

checking for GTK... yes
checking for DBUS... yes
checking for GSTREAMER... yes
checking for GCONF... yes

=> GTK subsystem detection

If you installed other packages to fix errors or enable
additional feature (and remove something) just call

./configure

again.

Build
-----

Just call

make

(if you have a multi-processor system you can also call "make -j 3"
for building three sources in parallel on a dual-core machine).

If there is no error you can continue with the set up of the
environment to build applications based on libIllumination.

Environment settings
====================

To use Illumination without installation and also build Illumination
base application without installing Illumination the following environment
settings are suggested:

To get the Illumination library found:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to Illumination>src/.libs

To get Illumination find its language catalogs:

ILLUMINATION_ROOT=<path to Illumination>

To the autoconf/automake configure scripts find the Illumination headers
and libraries:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:<path to Illumination>

Building applications
=====================

You can now build application using libIlluminations. For exmaple to checkout
the Illumination demos just call:

svn checkout http://illumination.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/illumination/trunk/Demos <target directory>

Or for EightyOne the Sudoku clone:

svn checkout http://illumination.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/illumination/trunk/EightyOne <target directory>

<target directory> should again be an empty directory, bested named by the application name
(Demos or EightyOne in this case).

All applications again use a configure script to detected dependencies and create makefiles.
Normally just doing:

./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

Should build the application ("&&" just executes the commands in row if the last command was
successful).

After that you can start the application by just calling it:

./Demos/src/Simple
./Demos/src/Controls

or

./EightyOne/src/EightyOne
